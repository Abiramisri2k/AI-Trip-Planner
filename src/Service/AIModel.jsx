Wear comfortable shoes.\n    *   **Public Transportation:** The Deuce bus is an affordable way to travel up and down the Strip and to Downtown. Consider a day pass.\n    *   **Ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft):**  Use these for shorter distances or when time is limited, but be aware of surge pricing.\n    *   **Free Shuttles:** Some hotels offer free shuttles to other hotels or attractions. Check with your hotel.\n*   **Food & Drinks:**\n    *   **Happy Hour:** Take advantage of happy hour deals at bars and restaurants for discounted drinks and appetizers.\n    *   **Grocery Stores:**  Buy snacks, drinks, and breakfast items at a grocery store (like Walgreens, CVS, or a local supermarket) to save money.\n    *   **Buffets:**  While buffets can be tempting, they can also be expensive. Look for lunch buffets for better deals.\n    *   **Coupon Books/Deals:** Check for coupon books or online deals for discounts on attractions, shows, and restaurants.\n*   **Gambling:** Set a strict budget for gambling and stick to it!\n*   **Free Activities:**  Vegas has tons of free things to do – focus on those.\n*   **Hotel Fees:** Be aware of resort fees, which are often added to the room rate and cover amenities like Wi-Fi and pool access. Factor these into your budget.\n\n**Customization:**\n\nThis is a template.  Feel free to adjust the itinerary to your interests. If you are interested in shopping for the entire 3 days, then customize the places accordingly.\n\n*   **Shows:**  If you want to see a show, look for discounted tickets or matinee performances.\n*   **Museums:** Consider a museum if you're interested in art, history, or specific themes (e.g., the Mob Museum).\n*   **Day Trips:**  If you have extra time, you could take a day trip to the Hoover Dam or Red Rock Canyon (requires transportation).\n*   **Relaxation:** Schedule some downtime to relax by the pool or simply unwind in your hotel room.\n\nHave a great trip to Las Vegas! Remember to book flights and accommodation in advance to secure the best prices.\n",
